# ModMax-dRGT Black Hole Thermodynamics Project

This project investigates the corrected thermodynamics of AdS black holes in ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity, including logarithmic and exponential entropy corrections. It is based on the manuscript:

**Corrected Thermodynamics of AdS Black Holes in ModMax-dRGT-like Massive Gravity**  
Authors: Dhruba Jyoti Gogoi, Arnav Kapoor

## Structure
- `ModMax_dRGT_BH_Thermo_Notes.md`: Main scientific notes and draft
- `Section_II_AdS_BH_Solutions.md`: AdS black hole solutions in ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity
- `Thermo_Calculations.ipynb`: Notebook for thermodynamic calculations and plots
- `figures/`: All generated figures and plots

## Goals
- Derive and analyze quantum-corrected thermodynamic quantities
- Visualize phase transitions and stability
- Provide a reproducible workflow for black hole thermodynamics research

## References
