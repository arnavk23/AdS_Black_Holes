# II. ADS Black Hole Solutions in ModMax-dRGT-like Massive Gravity

## Overview
This section will present the metric, field equations, and key properties of AdS black holes in ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity. It will summarize the main results from the reference paper and set up the background for thermodynamic analysis.

## Steps
- Write the general form of the metric
- List the relevant action and field equations
- Summarize the solution features (horizon structure, mass, charge, cosmological constant, massive gravity terms)
- Prepare for thermodynamic calculations
